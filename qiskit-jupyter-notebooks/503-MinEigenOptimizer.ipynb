    "# Minimum Eigen Optimizer\n",

    "\n",
    "Finding the solution to a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization(QUBO) problem is equivalent in finding the ground state of a corresponding Ising Hamiltonian - applicable to optimization, quantum chemistry and physics.\n",
    "The binary variables {0,1} are replaced by spin variables with values {âˆ’1,+1}, which allows to replace the resulting spin variables by Pauli Z matrices, and thus, an Ising Hamiltonian. \n",
    "Details on this mapping -> [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "Qiskit provides automatic conversion from a suitable QuadraticProgram to an Ising Hamiltonian, which then allows to leverage all the MinimumEigenSolver such as - VQE, - QAOA, or - NumpyMinimumEigensolver(classical exact method).\n",
    "\n",
    "Qiskit wraps the translation to an Ising Hamiltonian (in Qiskit Aqua also called Operator), the call to an MinimumEigensolver as well as the translation of the results back to OptimizationResult in the MinimumEigenOptimizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following we first illustrate the conversion from a QuadraticProgram to an Operator and then show how to use the MinimumEigenOptimizer with different MinimumEigensolver to solve a given QuadraticProgram. The algorithms in Qiskit automatically try to convert a given problem to the supported problem class if possible, for instance, the MinimumEigenOptimizer will automatically translate integer variables to binary variables or add a linear equality constraints as a quadratic penalty term to the objective. It should be mentioned that Aqua will through a QiskitOptimizationError if conversion of a quadratic program with integer variable is attempted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The circuit depth of QAOA potentially has to be increased with the problem size, which might be prohibitive for near-term quantum devices. A possible workaround is Recursive QAOA, as introduced in [2]. Qiskit generalizes this concept to the RecursiveMinimumEigenOptimizer, which is introduced at the end of this tutorial.\n",

A rather small number of scenarios are simulated under simplifying assumptions 

Complex scenarios in chemistry finance etc. not only enhancing information but how to predict more accurately with less samples - in a recent paper this has been illustrated to produce better results than Monte Carlo estimation

We have qiskit examples of portfolio Optimisation, trading simulations with near-term devices. We have limitation at present to apply these examples in commercial fields yet but with machines having better qV in future such limitations will slowly fade out.

## Vehicle Route Optimisation

That applies, for example, to production issues, worldwide component and data logistics, and the optimization of vehicle production planning in Daimler’s plants all over the world. 

Daimler and some other company they are in Qnetwork and we have performed the vehicle route Optimisation – besides productivity, manufacturing these are being looked at

For example simulate Lithium sulphate to show it has better capacity of power and may help produce longer lasting batteries, energy efficient and better for the environment.
